<div id="intro">
  <p>
    Have you always wanted to become a conference speaker?
  </p>
  <p>
    Let 2018 be the year that you make that dream a reality!
  </p>
  <p>
    On Saturday 27th January 2018 there will be numerous workshops hosted around the globe. The aim being to encourage and advise newbie speakers to put together their very first talk proposal and share their own indivdual perspective on any tech related subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each workshop will have experienced speakers on hand to:
    <ol>
      <li>give you a warm, inclusive welcome in a safe space (check out our <a href="CoC">Code of Conduct</a> which all participants must adhere to)</li>
      <li>mentor you with your proposal</li>
      <li>provide speaking advice</li>
      <li>and share their enthusiasm to get you to the stage!</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you need to do next? Sign up to a <a href="#cities">workshop at a location</a> near you and, if you have one, bring a laptop along to submit that proposal. If you have a spare laptop bring it along incase it can help someone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    These workshops will not focus on a specific language, framework or process. It's completely fine if your talk isn't even related to tech too. In short, if there is something that you want to shout to the world we're here to help you get there regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities. Thereby potentially increasing the diversity of every tech event around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been many diversity outreach efforts in the past, and we are still on the long journey to achieve equality in tech. Please join us on Saturday 27th January 2018 to take that first step to bring your unique voice to the stage.
  </p>
