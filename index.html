    Have you always wanted to become a conference speaker?
  </p>
  <p>
    Let 2018 be the year that you make that dream a reality!
  </p>
  <p>
    On Saturday 27th January 2018 there will be numerous workshops hosted around the globe to encourage and advise newbie speakers on putting together their very first talk proposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each workshop will have experienced speakers on hand to mentor you with your proposal and provide speaking advice!
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you need to do next? Sign up to a <a href="#cities">workshop at a location</a> near you and, if you have one, bring a laptop along to submit that proposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    These workshops will not have a specific technology, devops or process focus. The aim is to encourage people from all underrepresented groups to apply to speak regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities.
